# SFI 2024 GraphQL App

## ðŸ‘€ Overview

The application was prepared for the conference: ["SFI IT Academic Festival"](https://sfi.pl/en/) as part of the workshop: ["A quick dive into GraphQL"](https://sfi.pl/en/editions/19th-sfi-academic-festiwal/workshops/tbd/).

## ðŸ“š About the workshop

If youâ€™re tired of creating another REST app and would like to learn an alternative approach to API development, this workshop is for you! During the workshop, we will build an application in Node (TypeScript), which will expose an API in GraphQL. We will discuss the pros and cons of this solution, compare it with other standards, and address the most common problems encountered when creating public interfaces.

Individual steps will be available on branches, the names of which will reflect the order of tasks performed.
